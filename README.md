# 🎬 Movies Database Test Automation Framework

This test automation framework is designed for **API, Mobile, and Web testing** of The Movie Database applications. 🚀

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **API Testing** 🧪: Supports mock and integration tests to validate backend functionality.
- **Mobile Testing** 📱: Uses [Appium](http://appium.io/) for automated UI tests on emulators and real devices.
- **Technologies** ⚙️: Built with **Java**, **Selenium**, and **Appium**, powered by **Cucumber** for BDD. The framework is simple to set up and run using **Maven**.
- **Design Pattern** 🏗️: Follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** for maintainable and scalable test code.


# API TESTS

## Running Mock API Tests
To run the mock API tests, use the following command:
```bash
 mvn test -Dtest=com.moviedb.api.runners.TestRunner -DtestMode=mock
```

## Running Integration API Tests

To run the integration API tests, use the following command:
```bash
 mvn test -Dtest=com.moviedb.api.runners.TestRunner
 ```
 
Note: For demonstration purposes, the movie service API key is stored in the properties file. This approach is not recommended due to security risks. It is intended as a temporary solution solely for demo purposes.
